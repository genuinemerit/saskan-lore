# R6 Test Cases

## Unit Tests

**File:** `tests/unit/r6_evaluation/test_r6_evaluation.py`

15 tests. All pass.

| ID | Function | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-R6-01 | `load_eval_questions` | Loads all entries from a valid JSON file; DB count matches |
| TC-R6-02 | `load_eval_questions` | Idempotent: second load skips all entries, inserts none |
| TC-R6-03 | `load_eval_questions` | `question_id` is the idempotence key; same ID from two loads is skipped |
| TC-R6-04 | `load_eval_questions` | Raises `ValueError` when file fails `testing_schema.json` validation |
| TC-R6-05 | `run_evaluation` | Creates exactly one `EvalResult` per active question |
| TC-R6-06 | `run_evaluation` | `pass_fail` and `failure_type` are `None` on all new results |
| TC-R6-07 | `run_evaluation` | `retrieved_evidence` is a valid JSON-encoded list on every result |
| TC-R6-08 | `run_evaluation` | Returns `[]` and writes no records when no questions exist |
| TC-R6-09 | `grade_result` | Sets `pass_fail`, `failure_type`, and `notes` correctly on a result |
| TC-R6-10 | `grade_result` | Raises `ValueError` when `pass_fail` is not `"pass"` or `"fail"` |
| TC-R6-11 | `grade_result` | Raises `ValueError` for an unrecognised `failure_type` value |
| TC-R6-12 | `grade_result` | Raises `ValueError` when `result_id` does not exist |
| TC-R6-13 | `eval_summary` | Returns correct `passed`, `failed`, `ungraded`, and `failures` counts |
| TC-R6-14 | `eval_summary` | Ungraded results increment `ungraded`, not `passed` or `failed` |
| TC-R6-15 | `export_results` | Writes a valid JSON file with one entry per result, joined to question |

## Integration Tests

**File:** `tests/integration/test_r6_integration.py`

**Fixture:** `tests/fixtures/synthetic_lore.txt` — 5-sentence synthetic text used as a
stand-in for a real lore PDF.

**Mocks:** `inference.complete()` (returns a controlled staging JSON with IDs parsed from
the prompt string); `answering.answer()` (returns a fixed `AnswerResult`). No GGUF model
required. All DB operations, file I/O, and FTS5 indexing run against real code.

8 tests across two parts. All pass.

### Part A — Ingest to load

| ID | Test | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-R6-INT-A1 | `test_a1_register_and_chunk` | `register_document()` and `load_chunks()` populate `documents` and `chunks` tables |
| TC-R6-INT-A2 | `test_a2_extract_writes_staging_files` | `extract_chunk()` with mocked inference writes one staging file per chunk, no error files |
| TC-R6-INT-A3 | `test_a3_load_approved_claims_into_db` | After approving staging files, `load_file()` inserts approved claims into the DB |
| TC-R6-INT-A4 | `test_a4_fts5_index_populated_after_load` | FTS5 index contains the loaded claims; keyword query returns results |

### Part B — Questions, evaluate, grade, summary, export

| ID | Test | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TC-R6-INT-B1 | `test_b1_load_eval_questions` | `load_eval_questions()` inserts questions and is idempotent on a second call |
| TC-R6-INT-B2 | `test_b2_run_evaluation_creates_results` | `run_evaluation()` creates one `EvalResult` per question with `pass_fail=None` and correct `retrieved_evidence` |
| TC-R6-INT-B3 | `test_b3_grade_and_summary` | `grade_result()` and `eval_summary()` return correct pass/fail/failure counts end-to-end |
| TC-R6-INT-B4 | `test_b4_export_produces_valid_json` | `export_results()` writes all results joined to questions with correct field values |

## System Acceptance Test (Linux — partial run)

**Date:** 2026-04-03 to 2026-04-04
**Platform:** Dell XPS 13, Ubuntu Linux, Intel i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM, CPU-only inference
**Model:** Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf, `gpu_layers=0`
**Reference:** `docs/design/r6_evaluation/system_test.md`
**Export:** `docs/design/r6_evaluation/eval_export_20260404_163644.json`

### Results summary

| Phase | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 — DB init | Pass |
| 2 — Ingest (1210 chunks) | Pass |
| 3 — Extraction (323/1210 chunks) | Pass — stopped after 12 hours; 0 errors |
| 4 — Human review (150 files) | Pass — 191 approved claims |
| 5 — Load | Pass — 191 claims, 205 entities, 179 links loaded |
| 6a — Load eval questions | Pass — 10 questions, idempotent |
| 6b — Run evaluation | Pass — 10 results written |
| 6c — Human grading | Pass — all 10 graded |
| 6d — Eval summary | 1/10 pass (10%) — below graduation threshold |
| 7 — Export and reset | Pass — results exported; DB wiped and reinitialized |

### Grading detail

| Question | Result ID | Grade | Failure type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q_001 — How many provinces are full members? | 1 | fail | incomplete | No matching claims retrieved |
| q_002 — When did Eelan accept protection? | 2 | fail | incomplete | No matching claims retrieved |
| q_003 — How does the Covenant function? | 3 | fail | incomplete | No matching claims retrieved |
| q_004 — What is the role of the Varkaar Council? | 4 | fail | incomplete | No matching claims retrieved |
| q_005 — What is the Great Ring Road? | 5 | **pass** | — | Correct substance; verbose/repetitive |
| q_006 — What are the Articles of Borded? | 6 | fail | incomplete | Evidence retrieved but too thin to answer |
| q_007 — In what era did the Eelani-Futanik War occur? | 7 | fail | incomplete | No matching claims retrieved |
| q_008 — What are the Ring Runners? | 8 | fail | incomplete | No matching claims retrieved |
| q_009 — What is the Varkaar Union? | 9 | fail | incomplete | Evidence retrieved; model hedged correctly |
| q_010 — What is the Cann of Borded? | 10 | fail | hallucination | Model said "Cann of Byenung"; correct name is "Cann of Borded" |

### Bugs found during acceptance run

Seven patch items identified (BL-019, BL-021 through BL-028). All code bugs fixed in
`v0.6.1` working tree. See `docs/design/backlog.md` for full details.

### Graduation status

**Not yet declared.** 1/10 pass is expected given partial extraction (323/1210 chunks).
The 8 `incomplete` failures are a data coverage problem, not a pipeline defect. The
`hallucination` on q_010 is a genuine model quality issue worth tracking on the Mac run.

macOS acceptance test (full extraction, 7B model, Metal GPU) is the next milestone.
